3D printer / CNC machine controller:   

The final system will be broken across three boards, to allow for modularity, replacement of the modules individually, upgradability, and to allow enough space for proper
design of the power electronics.   

a) Microcontroller, UI, storage, display, connectivity etc.   
b) Power distribution, switching, heater control etc.   
c) Stepper motor drivers.
